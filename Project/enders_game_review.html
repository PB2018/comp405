			<p class="review">
				Ender’s Game, written by Orson Scott Card, is a classic science fiction novel and was one the first science fiction books that I read. It fits the very strict definition of science fiction in that the book follows many actual scientific principles that other works in the genre ignore such as relativity when dealing with space travel and that would affect both the individuals and any type of warfare being pursued in outer space. The only thing that it hand-waves away is faster-than-light communications which is said to be done through a quantum entanglement principle, which is an idea that has been floating around since quantum mechanics entered the public awareness.<br> The book focuses on the main character, Andrew Wiggin, who was nicknamed “Ender” by his sister because when they were children, she had trouble pronouncing his name. The book follows this character as he is forcibly drafted into a military training school. For several generations, the Earth has been at war with alien invaders known as the Formic and all her governments have been working cooperatively to both find and recruit the smartest military minds to lead their future fleet in battle with these enemies. The bulk of the story takes place in a space station called the Battle School, where Ender must learn to make friends, deal with rivals and adversaries who are much older and stronger than him, and learn to battle enemies in a very cutthroat environment.<br> One of the reasons I love this novel so much is that it is not written for children, yet I read it as a pre-teen, and it focuses on kids. Unlike most of books I was reading at the time, this book treats the reader as someone who knows plenty and does not need a hand held through any of the plot’s twists and turns. It is also fascinating because it really digs deeply into the psychology of the characters, as well as the length that people are willing to go to achieve their goals. The book also has a fantastic twist brought about because of rich characters and a world that is fully realized.
