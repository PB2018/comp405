			<p class="review">
				Hounded, by Kevin Hearne, is one my all-time favorite fantasy books. The key reason I love this book so much is the basic premise is fascinating. It is one of those books where all the gods and monsters are real and are living in modern times; however, the main character is not anything you expect in this type of story. He is a druid, which is not your typical modern fantasy character.  But, he does have a lot going for him that most other modern fantasy characters don't. He was born during the Iron Age, has lived with the fear of being hunted by a god of his own pantheon, and has the distinct abilities to gain strength from the earth as well as change shape into a few different animal forms.<br> The book picks up right where the main character is about to experience the greatest amount of change to who he is in the shortest period of time. The character has been around for millennia but most of his character development happened slowly in a 100-year time frame prior to the start of this story. Then, from the start to finish of the book, he drastically changes his character and motives over the course of a few weeks.  While this book at first seems like it is not following the key rule of, “Is this your character’s must important moments?” it quickly becomes those. While these may not be the biggest fights the character has ever endured, they certainly are the ones that have the most impact on him.<br> This novel is about how Atticus O'Sullivan deals with the fact that his old enemy, Aenghus Óg, has finally tracked him down again and how he reacts to this. The key difference in this story is that instead of running like he did before, he decides to stand his ground and fight. This drastically changes how the story plays out, as well as sets in motion several events that will follow in the subsequent books of the series.<br> One the reasons why love I this book so much is that, while maintaining the fairly common fantasy characters and gods in modern life scenarios, it focuses on gods and creatures that are not common in the mythologies. While there are vampires and werewolves, the main characters are generally the Tuatha Dé Danann, the old Irish gods, and the Druids and how they interact with the modern world. I also find this book fascinating because the characters change very rapidly but in very logical and realistic ways, and they deal with problems in a very unique manner.
